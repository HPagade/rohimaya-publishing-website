**How It Works:**
- Authors pay upfront for publishing services

- You profit from service fees + ongoing royalties

**Revenue Structure:**
- Publishing package: $2,000-5,000 per book
- Ongoing royalty share: 20-30% of sales
- Optional upgrades: Marketing, translation, audiobook

**Example:**
```
Author publishes with $3,500 package
Book sells 500 copies/year at $14.99
Your 25% royalty: $1,874/year
Plus initial: $3,500
Total Year 1: $5,374 per author

With 20 authors: $107,480/year
With 50 authors: $268,700/year
```
