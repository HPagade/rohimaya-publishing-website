## 🎯 TWO PRODUCT STRATEGY OPTIONS

### **OPTION A: UNIFIED SUITE (RECOMMENDED)** ⭐

**ONE brand that includes EVERYTHING:**
- Book formatting
- Cover generation
- Image creation
- Video production

**Why This Works:**
✅ Simpler for customers (one brand to remember)
✅ Easier to market (one message)
✅ Higher perceived value (complete solution)
✅ Better retention (sticky ecosystem)
✅ Cross-sell opportunities built-in

---

### **OPTION B: SEPARATE PRODUCTS**

**TWO distinct brands:**
- Brand #1: AI Book Formatter
- Brand #2: AI Creative Suite

**Why You Might Do This:**
✅ Target different audiences (formatters = tech-focused, design = creative)
✅ Different pricing strategies
✅ Sell one without the other
✅ Potential to sell separately later
