async function detectChapters(manuscriptText) {
  // 1. Send text to OpenAI with specific instructions
  const prompt = `Analyze this manuscript and identify 
  chapter breaks. Return JSON with chapter titles 
  and page numbers.`;
  
  // 2. Call API (you'll learn async/await here)
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
  });
  
  // 3. Parse response (you'll learn JSON handling)
  const chapters = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
  
  // 4. Return structured data
  return chapters;
}
```

**You'll learn:**
- API calls and promises
- Async programming
