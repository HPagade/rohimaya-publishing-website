## 🎯 Two Business Models

You're building TWO revenue streams simultaneously:

### 1. Publishing Service ($1,500-2,500 per book)
- Traditional full-service publishing
- You format, design covers, create marketing
- Target: Authors who want done-for-you service
- Start THIS MONTH (doesn't require apps to be done)

### 2. SaaS Tools ($29-199/month subscriptions)
- PhoenixForge AI apps
- Authors do it themselves with AI
- Target: Tech-savvy DIY authors
- Launch in 30 days

**Strategy:** Start #1 immediately for cash flow, build #2 in parallel!
